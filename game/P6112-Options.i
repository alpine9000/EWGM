P61pl=usecode&$400000

split4=0	;Great time gain, but INCOMPATIBLE with F03, F02, and F01
		;speeds in the song! That's the ONLY reason it's default 0.
		;So ==> PLEASE try split4=1 in ANY mode!
		;Overrides splitchans to decrunch 1 chan/frame.
		;See ;@@ note for P61_SetPosition.


splitchans=1	;#channels to be split off to be decrunched at "playtime frame"
		;0=use normal "decrunch all channels in the same frame"
		;Experiment to find minimum rastertime, but it should be 1 or 2
		;for 3-4 channels songs and 0 or 1 with less channels.

visuctrs=0	;enables visualizers in this example: P61_visuctr0..3.w 
		;containing #frames (#lev6ints if cia=1) elapsed since last
		;instrument triggered. (0=triggered this frame.)
		;Easy alternative to E8x or 1Fx sync commands.

asmonereport=0	;ONLY for printing a settings report on assembly. Use
		;if you get problems (only works in AsmOne/AsmPro, tho)

p61system=0	;1=system-friendly. Use for DOS/Workbench programs.

p61exec	=0	;0 if execbase is destroyed, such as in a trackmo.

p61fade	=1	;enable channel volume fading from your demo

	if SFX=1
channels=3	;<4 for game sound effects in the higher channels. Incompatible
		; with splitchans/split4.
	else
channels=4
	endif

playflag=0	;1=enable music on/off capability (at run-time). .If 0, you can
		;still do this by just, you know, not calling P61_Music...
		;It's a convenience function to "pause" music in CIA mode.

p61bigjtab=0	;1 to waste 480b and save max 56 cycles on 68000.

opt020	=0	;1=enable optimizations for 020+. Please be 68000 compatible!
		;splitchans will already give MUCH bigger gains, and you can
		;try the MAXOPTI mode.

p61jump	=0	;0 to leave out P61_SetPosition (size gain)
		;1 if you need to force-start at a given position fex in a game

C	=0	;If you happen to have some $dffxxx value in a6, you can 
		;change this to $xxx to not have to load it before P61_Music.

clraudxdat=0	;enable smoother start of quiet sounds. probably not needed.

optjmp	=1	;0=safety check for jump beyond end of song. Clear it if you 
		;play unknown P61 songs with erroneous Bxx/Dxx commands in them

oscillo	=0	;1 to get a sample window (ptr, size) to read and display for 
		;oscilloscope type effects (beta, noshorts=1, pad instruments)
		;IMPORTANT: see ;@@ note about chipmem dc.w buffer.

quietstart=0	;attempt to avoid the very first click in some modules
		;IMPORTANT: see ;@@ note about chipmem dc.w buffer.

use1Fx=0	;Optional extra effect-sync trigger (*). If your module is free
		;from E commands, and you add E8x to sync stuff, this will 
		;change the usecode to include a whole code block for all E 
		;commands. You can avoid this by only using 1Fx. (You can 
		;also use this as an extra sync command if E8x is not enough, 
		;of course.)

;(*) Slideup values>116 causes bugs in Protracker, and E8 causes extra-code 
;for all E-commands, so I used this. It's only faster if your song contains 0
;E-commands, so it's only useful to a few, I guess. Bit of cyclemania. :)

;Just like E8x, you will get the trigger after the P61_Music call, 1 frame 
;BEFORE it's heard. This is good, because it allows double-buffered graphics 
;or effects running at < 50 fps to show the trigger synced properly.
